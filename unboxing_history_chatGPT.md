# Unboxing history data manipulation written with ChatGPT

**Human:**
I have pandas dataframes in a list called df_list.
Dataframes have columns named 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'rarity', 'color', 'extraInfo'
Every dataframe in a list corresponds to some month.
Case name contains strings that are names of cases.
Unboxing number is the number of said case unboxed in that month.
I want every column except 'Case Name' and 'Unboxing Number' gone and then I need all dataframes compiled into a single dataframe that has case names as columns. In the end, I want a dataframe that has unboxing numbers for each case for each month. The specific month names do not matter, the initial list is already sorted in time.

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! You can achieve this using pandas' data manipulation functions. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Extract 'Case Name' and 'Unboxing Number' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Optional: fill missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Display the final dataframe
print(df_pivoted)

```

Note that in the above example, you need to replace 'month' with the actual column name in your dataframes that represents the month information. Also, if you want to keep other columns such as 'rarity', 'color', and 'extraInfo', you can modify the first line where you extract columns from each dataframe to include those columns as well.

***

**Human:**
Can you modify the code to ignore the months as there is no column in the original dataframe that has month information?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! If you don't have a specific column that represents the month information in your original dataframes, you can create a new column in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the `df_list`. Here's an updated example:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Optional: fill missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Display the final dataframe
print(df_pivoted)

```

In this updated example, a new column 'Month' is added to each dataframe in the `df_list` to represent the month information based on its position in the list. Then, this 'Month' column is used in the `pivot` function to create the final dataframe with 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values.

***

**Human:**
Good job! Now, I actually want case names not alphabetically sorted, but to have the same order as in the original dataframe. Is this possible?

***

**Assistant:**

Yes, you can achieve that by creating a custom sorting order for the 'Case Name' column in the final pivoted dataframe based on the order in the original dataframe. Here's an updated example:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Set a custom sorting order for the 'Case Name' column in the final pivoted dataframe
df_pivoted['Case Name'] = pd.Categorical(df_pivoted['Case Name'], categories=case_names_order, ordered=True)

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted.sort_values('Case Name', inplace=True)

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Optional: fill missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Display the final dataframe
print(df_pivoted)

```

In this updated example, after pivoting the concatenated dataframe, a custom sorting order for the 'Case Name' column is set using `pd.Categorical` with the `categories` parameter set to the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order. Then, the final pivoted dataframe is sorted based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name' using `sort_values` function.

***

**Human:**
line 'df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)' raises 'TypeError: Cannot setitem on a Categorical with a new category (0), set the categories first'
why could that be?

***

**Assistant:**

I apologize for the confusion. You're correct. Since we have set a custom sorting order for the 'Case Name' column using `pd.Categorical`, which results in categorical data type for that column, we cannot directly fill in missing values with 0 using the `fillna()` function. Instead, we can use the `cat.add_categories()` method to add 0 as a category to the 'Case Name' column, and then fill in the missing values with the newly added category.

Here's the updated code to handle this scenario:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Set a custom sorting order for the 'Case Name' column in the final pivoted dataframe
df_pivoted['Case Name'] = pd.Categorical(df_pivoted['Case Name'], categories=case_names_order, ordered=True)

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted.sort_values('Case Name', inplace=True)

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with NaN
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.fillna(pd.NA)

# Set 0 as a category in the 'Case Name' column
df_pivoted['Case Name'] = df_pivoted['Case Name'].cat.add_categories([0])

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Display the final dataframe
print(df_pivoted)

```

In this updated code, we first fill in missing values with `pd.NA` to mark them as NaN. Then we use the `cat.add_categories()` method to add 0 as a category to the 'Case Name' column. Finally, we fill in the missing values with 0 using `fillna()` function.

***

**Human:**
2 / 2
Can we just convert case names back to strings instead of doing sheneningans with categories?

***

**Assistant:**

Yes, you can convert the 'Case Name' column back to strings instead of using categories. Here's the modified code to achieve that:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.sort_values(by='Case Name', key=lambda x: x.map({case: i for i, case in enumerate(case_names_order)}))

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Convert 'Case Name' back to strings
df_pivoted['Case Name'] = df_pivoted['Case Name'].astype(str)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Display the final dataframe
print(df_pivoted)

```

In this modified code, we removed the usage of `pd.Categorical` and converted the 'Case Name' column back to strings using the `astype()` function. The sorting of the dataframe is done using the `sort_values()` function with a custom sorting key that maps the 'Case Name' values to their original order in the `case_names_order` list.

***

**Human:**
does this still need this line 'df_pivoted['Case Name'] = df_pivoted['Case Name'].astype(str)'?

***

**Assistant:**

I apologize for the confusion. The `df_pivoted['Case Name'] = df_pivoted['Case Name'].astype(str)` line is not necessary in the modified code, as the 'Case Name' column will already be of type string after pivoting the dataframe. You can remove that line from the code. Here's the updated code without that line:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.sort_values(by='Case Name', key=lambda x: x.map({case: i for i, case in enumerate(case_names_order)}))

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Display the final dataframe
print(df_pivoted)

```

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response.

**Human:**
Now I need this dataframe transposed so that case names are column names and month numbers are indexes

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! To transpose the dataframe so that case names are column names and month numbers are indexes, you can use the `transpose()` method in pandas. Here's the updated code:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.sort_values(by='Case Name', key=lambda x: x.map({case: i for i, case in enumerate(case_names_order)}))

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Transpose the dataframe
df_transposed = df_pivoted.set_index('Case Name').transpose()

# Reset the index name
df_transposed.index.name = 'Month'

# Display the transposed dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

This will give you a dataframe where case names are column names and month numbers are indexes, with unboxing numbers as the corresponding values.

***

**Human:**
I want you to make the index have no name

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! You can simply set the index name to `None` in pandas using the `rename_axis()` method. Here's the updated code:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.sort_values(by='Case Name', key=lambda x: x.map({case: i for i, case in enumerate(case_names_order)}))

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Rename the columns to have meaningful names
df_pivoted.columns.name = None

# Transpose the dataframe
df_transposed = df_pivoted.set_index('Case Name').transpose()

# Reset the index name to None
df_transposed.index.name = None

# Display the transposed dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

This will give you a dataframe where case names are column names and month numbers are indexes, with unboxing numbers as the corresponding values, and the index has no name.

***

**Human:**
Can you remove 'df_pivoted.columns.name = None' and 'df_transposed.index.name = None' alltogether?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's the updated code with the lines removed:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.sort_values(by='Case Name', key=lambda x: x.map({case: i for i, case in enumerate(case_names_order)}))

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Transpose the dataframe
df_transposed = df_pivoted.set_index('Case Name').transpose()

# Display the transposed dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

This will give you the same result as before, with the index and column names unchanged from the default behavior in pandas.

Add a column to the df_transposed named 'Month'
The first value should be january of 2022 and every next value has to be the next month. Note that I have more than 12 values, so I want the month after december 2022 to be january 2023 and so on

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's an updated version of the code that adds a 'Month' column to the `df_transposed` dataframe with the month and year values as described:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', 'Month']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.sort_values(by='Case Name', key=lambda x: x.map({case: i for i, case in enumerate(case_names_order)}))

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Transpose the dataframe
df_transposed = df_pivoted.set_index('Case Name').transpose()

# Add a 'Month' column with month and year values
start_month = datetime.date(2022, 1, 1)  # assuming start month is January 2022
df_transposed['Month'] = [(start_month + pd.DateOffset(months=i)).strftime('%B %Y') for i in range(len(df_transposed))]

# Display the transposed dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

The `Month` column will have values like "January 2022", "February 2022", and so on, based on the number of columns in the `df_transposed` dataframe.

import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Transpose the dataframe
df_transposed = df_pivoted.set_index('Case Name').transpose()

# Add a 'Month' column with month and year values
start_month = dt.date(2022, 1, 1)  # assuming start month is January 2022
df_transposed['Month'] = [(start_month + pd.DateOffset(months=i)).strftime('%B %Y') for i in range(len(df_transposed))]

# Display the transposed dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

Note that `datetime` has been imported as `dt` as per your request, and the code has been updated accordingly to use `dt.date` instead of `datetime.date`.

***

**Human:**
I want 'Month' to be the first column of the resulting dataframe

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's an updated version of the code that moves the 'Month' column to be the first column in the resulting dataframe:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_list is the list of dataframes you have

# Add a new column 'Month' in each dataframe to represent the month based on its position in the list
for i, df in enumerate(df_list):
    df['Month'] = i + 1  # assuming month indexing starts from 1

# Extract 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number', and 'Month' columns from each dataframe in the list
df_list = [df[['Month', 'Case Name', 'Unboxing Number']] for df in df_list]

# Concatenate the dataframes in the list vertically
df_concatenated = pd.concat(df_list)

# Pivot the concatenated dataframe to get 'Case Name' as columns and 'Unboxing Number' as values
df_pivoted = df_concatenated.pivot(index='Case Name', columns='Month', values='Unboxing Number')

# Reset the index to make 'Case Name' a column again
df_pivoted.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Get the unique 'Case Name' values from the original dataframes in the same order
case_names_order = df_list[0]['Case Name'].values

# Sort the dataframe based on the custom sorting order of 'Case Name'
df_pivoted = df_pivoted.sort_values(by='Case Name', key=lambda x: x.map({case: i for i, case in enumerate(case_names_order)}))

# Reset the index
df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Transpose the dataframe
df_transposed = df_pivoted.set_index('Case Name').transpose()

# Add a 'Month' column with month and year values
start_month = dt.date(2022, 1, 1)  # assuming start month is January 2022
df_transposed['Month'] = [(start_month + pd.DateOffset(months=i)).strftime('%B %Y') for i in range(len(df_transposed))]

# Move the 'Month' column to be the first column in the dataframe
cols = df_transposed.columns.tolist()
cols = ['Month'] + cols[:-1]
df_transposed = df_transposed[cols]

# Display the transposed dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

Now the resulting dataframe will have the 'Month' column as the first column.

df_pivoted.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Fill in missing values with 0
df_pivoted.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Transpose the dataframe
df_transposed = df_pivoted.set_index('Case Name').transpose()

# Add a 'Month' column with month and year values as dates
start_month = dt.date(2022, 1, 1)  # assuming start month is January 2022
df_transposed['Month'] = [start_month + pd.DateOffset(months=i) for i in range(len(df_transposed))]

# Move the 'Month' column to be the first column in the dataframe
cols = df_transposed.columns.tolist()
cols = ['Month'] + cols[:-1]
df_transposed = df_transposed[cols]

# Display the transposed dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

Now the 'Month' column in the resulting dataframe will contain dates instead of strings.

From now on assume you're working with the resulting df_transposed dataframe as the input, do not show me the old code.
The current dataframe has monthly data.
I want a dataframe that has daily unboxing data. For each day it would be number for the given month divided by the amount of days in this month.
Be aware that you are working with the resulting dataframe, not the original one.
Also, try to avoid importing anything other than pandas and datetime if possible

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's the updated code to calculate the daily unboxing data from the monthly data in the `df_transposed` dataframe, assuming you are working with the `df_transposed` dataframe as the input:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_transposed is the resulting dataframe

# Convert 'Month' column to datetime objects
df_transposed['Month'] = pd.to_datetime(df_transposed['Month'])

# Set 'Month' column as the index
df_transposed.set_index('Month', inplace=True)

# Get the number of days in each month
df_transposed['Days in Month'] = df_transposed.index.daysinmonth

# Divide the monthly unboxing data by the number of days in the month to get daily unboxing data
for col in df_transposed.columns[:-1]:  # exclude the last column 'Days in Month'
    df_transposed[col] = df_transposed[col] / df_transposed['Days in Month']

# Drop the 'Days in Month' column
df_transposed.drop('Days in Month', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Reset the index
df_transposed.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Display the updated dataframe
print(df_transposed)

```

Now the `df_transposed` dataframe will contain daily unboxing data calculated by dividing the monthly unboxing data by the number of days in the respective month.

I want you to operate on a copy of df_transposed
Also, rename 'Month' to 'Date' after all the manipulations are done

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's the updated code that operates on a copy of `df_transposed`, renames 'Month' to 'Date' after all manipulations are done, and calculates daily unboxing data:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_transposed is the resulting dataframe

# Create a copy of df_transposed
df_copy = df_transposed.copy()

# Convert 'Month' column to datetime objects
df_copy['Month'] = pd.to_datetime(df_copy['Month'])

# Set 'Month' column as the index
df_copy.set_index('Month', inplace=True)

# Get the number of days in each month
df_copy['Days in Month'] = df_copy.index.daysinmonth

# Divide the monthly unboxing data by the number of days in the month to get daily unboxing data
for col in df_copy.columns[:-1]:  # exclude the last column 'Days in Month'
    df_copy[col] = df_copy[col] / df_copy['Days in Month']

# Drop the 'Days in Month' column
df_copy.drop('Days in Month', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Reset the index
df_copy.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Rename 'Month' to 'Date'
df_copy.rename(columns={'Month': 'Date'}, inplace=True)

# Display the updated dataframe
print(df_copy)

```

Now the calculations are done on a copy of `df_transposed`, and the 'Month' column is renamed to 'Date' after all manipulations are performed.

***

**Human:**
Assume you're operating on the resulting dataframe(df_copy) from now on.
Right now, the 'Date' column only has first days of each month.
I want to have data for each day of the month(daily unboxings for each day of the same month are the same)

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here's the updated code that fills in daily unboxing data for each day of the month:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_copy is the resulting dataframe

# Create a copy of df_copy
df_copy2 = df_copy.copy()

# Set 'Date' column as the index
df_copy2.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Resample the dataframe to daily frequency and forward fill the values
df_copy2 = df_copy2.resample('D').ffill()

# Reset the index
df_copy2.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Display the updated dataframe
print(df_copy2)

```

This code uses the `resample` method to resample the data to daily frequency and then uses forward fill (`ffill()`) to fill in the unboxing data for each day of the month with the same value as the first day of the month. The resulting dataframe `df_copy2` will have daily unboxing data for each day of the month.

This is nice! The only problem is that the last month still has one value because the last date is the first day of the last month

***

**Assistant:**

I apologize for the oversight. You're right, the last month may have incomplete data if the last date is the first day of the month. Here's an updated version of the code that ensures all days of the last month have the same unboxing data as the last day of the previous month:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_copy is the resulting dataframe

# Create a copy of df_copy
df_copy2 = df_copy.copy()

# Set 'Date' column as the index
df_copy2.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Resample the dataframe to daily frequency and forward fill the values
df_copy2 = df_copy2.resample('D').ffill()

# Get the last date in the dataframe
last_date = df_copy2.index[-1]

# Get the last day of the month for the last date
last_day_of_month = last_date + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(0)

# If the last date is not the last day of the month, duplicate the last row with the last day of the month as the index
if last_date != last_day_of_month:
    last_row = df_copy2.iloc[-1]
    last_row.name = last_day_of_month
    df_copy2 = df_copy2.append(last_row)

# Reset the index
df_copy2.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Display the updated dataframe
print(df_copy2)

```

This updated code checks if the last date in the dataframe is not the last day of the month, and if so, duplicates the last row with the last day of the month as the index. This ensures that all days of the last month have the same unboxing data as the last day of the previous month in the resulting dataframe `df_copy2`.

***

**Human:**
Nice ideas, but it still needs adjustment to achieve what I want. I removed some redundant checks and changed the order so that values are filled after the last day of the month is appended.

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_copy is the resulting dataframe

# Create a copy of df_copy

df_copy2 = df_copy.copy()

# Set 'Date' column as the index

df_copy2.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

last_date = df_copy2.index[-1]
last_row = df_copy2.iloc[-1]
last_row.name = last_date + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(0)
df_copy2 = df_copy2.append(last_row)

# Resample the dataframe to daily frequency and forward fill the values

df_copy2 = df_copy2.resample('D').ffill()

# Reset the index

df_copy2.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Display the updated dataframe

print(df_copy2)
```

Can you comment my adjustents in the same way you commented all the other code?

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! Here are comments added to your adjusted code:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_copy is the resulting dataframe

# Create a copy of df_copy
df_copy2 = df_copy.copy()

# Set 'Date' column as the index
df_copy2.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Get the last date in the dataframe
last_date = df_copy2.index[-1]

# Get the last row of the dataframe
last_row = df_copy2.iloc[-1]

# Set the name of the last row as the last day of the month for the last date
last_row.name = last_date + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(0)

# Append the last row with the last day of the month as the index
df_copy2 = df_copy2.append(last_row)

# Resample the dataframe to daily frequency and forward fill the values
df_copy2 = df_copy2.resample('D').ffill()

# Reset the index
df_copy2.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Display the updated dataframe
print(df_copy2)

```

In your adjustments, you removed the redundant check for the last day of the month and changed the order of appending the last row and resampling the dataframe to daily frequency. This ensures that all days of the last month have the same unboxing data as the last day of the previous month in the resulting dataframe `df_copy2`.

**Human:**
Can you make it more future proof? There's a deprecated warning
'FutureWarning: The frame.append method is deprecated and will be removed from pandas in a future version. Use pandas.concat instead.
  df_copy2 = df_copy2.append(last_row)'

***

**Assistant:**

Sure! You can use the `pandas.concat` method instead of `DataFrame.append` to avoid the deprecated warning. Here's an updated version of the code with `pandas.concat`:

```Python 3
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt

# Assuming df_copy is the resulting dataframe

# Create a copy of df_copy
df_copy2 = df_copy.copy()

# Set 'Date' column as the index
df_copy2.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Get the last date in the dataframe
last_date = df_copy2.index[-1]

# Get the last row of the dataframe
last_row = df_copy2.iloc[-1]

# Set the name of the last row as the last day of the month for the last date
last_row.name = last_date + pd.offsets.MonthEnd(0)

# Concatenate the last row with the last day of the month as a new dataframe
df_copy2 = pd.concat([df_copy2, pd.DataFrame([last_row], columns=df_copy2.columns)])

# Resample the dataframe to daily frequency and forward fill the values
df_copy2 = df_copy2.resample('D').ffill()

# Reset the index
df_copy2.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Display the updated dataframe
print(df_copy2)

```

Using `pandas.concat` with a list of dataframes is a recommended way to concatenate dataframes and avoids the deprecated warning associated with `DataFrame.append`.
